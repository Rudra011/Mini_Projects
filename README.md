Mini Projects

Welcome to my collection of mini projects, built as part of my learning journey across programming, cybersecurity, game development, and creative software experiments.

This repository serves as a public archive of small but meaningful builds—projects I created while exploring new ideas, learning new technologies, or simply experimenting with concepts.
Each project may be simple, but together they reflect my growth as a developer.

📌 About This Repository

This repo contains projects from areas including:

C, C++, and Python programming

Cybersecurity utilities & scripts

SDL2 and game-logic prototypes

Web development (HTML, CSS, JS, APIs)

WPF tools, UI utilities, and desktop experiments

Miscellaneous creative or technical mini-projects

Every project is placed in its own folder with a short description so you can explore them easily.

🎯 Why I Made This Repo

To document and track my technical progress

To build a portfolio of small projects alongside major ones

To keep my experiments organized and accessible

To share useful code with anyone learning similar technologies
