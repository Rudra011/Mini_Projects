🌙 Mini Projects — A Developer’s Playground

Welcome to my personal playground of experiments, prototypes, and small-but-impactful builds.
This repository isn’t just a collection of random files — it’s a timeline of my growth as a developer, showing how I learn, break things, fix things, and create better versions of myself with every project.

Whether it’s C/C++ logic experiments, cybersecurity scripts, SDL2 mini games, WPF tools, or quick web dev builds, everything you see here started as a spark of curiosity.
