# 🎮 **Game of Guidance**
### *A Psychological Turn-Based Combat Game Built with Pygame*

A mind-bending, minimalist RPG where you battle your **inner demons** — not through brute force,  
but through willpower, choice, and sanity.  
Built entirely in **Python + Pygame**.

## 🌑 **Overview**

**Game of Guidance** is a short psychological experience featuring:

- Choice-based narrative branches  
- Turn-based combat against symbolic enemies  
- Health & sanity mechanics  
- Dynamic enemy AI using counter-attacks  
- A stylized UI made with core Pygame drawing

The game explores internal conflict through abstract enemies such as:

- **Thought Demon**  
- **Fear Entity**  
- **Doubt Shadow**

Each decision alters the path — courage leads to combat, fear leads to downfall.

## 🧠 **Concept**

This game is built around the theme of **internal struggle**.  
Every enemy represents a piece of the player’s mind, and the combat system reflects:

- Confusion (randomized enemy counters)
- Overthinking (high-damage mental attacks)
- Sanity loss (HP reduction & narrative consequences)

The goal isn’t just to win — it's to **understand what you’re fighting**.
